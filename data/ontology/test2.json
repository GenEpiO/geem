Ninety-eight districts (wilaya), each with at least one council, have been created to further increase local authority; the councils are also known as local government authorities. Currently there are 114 councils operating in 99 districts; 22 are urban and 92 are rural. The 22 urban units are further classified as city councils (Dar es Salaam and Mwanza), municipal councils (Arusha, Dodoma, Iringa, Kilimanjaro, Mbeya, Morogoro, Shinyanga, Tabora, and Tanga) or town councils (the remaining eleven communities).",

The only exception is the region housing the nation's capital, which is designated RM, that stands for Region Metropolitana (Metropolitan Region). Two new regions were created in 2006: Arica-Parinacota in the north, and Los Rios in the south. Both became operative in 2007-10.",
