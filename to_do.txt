	TO DO:

	 - Disjunction tabbed interface has wrong required status shown when
	 ontology detail switch is on?
	 - FIX: contact specification - physician not inheriting first name, last
	   name etc. from person (and check cardinality).
	 - How to handle items that are not marked as datums?
	 - possibly try: http://knockoutjs.com/index.html
	 - FIX: "has component some XYZ" where XYZ is a composite entity fails to
	   be recognized. using "min 1" instead of "some" is the workaround.
	 - accomodate "other" or "missing" etc. option directly in form data?
	 	EBI Taxonomy or Organism.  Requires “OTHER” plain text.
	    NIAID: Need "N/A" or "Unknown", "censored" as accepted value.
		Example Values:	+15.871732; +37.2556; unknown; censored
	 - Some specs like NCBI "Lat_lon or country" need to accomodate country 
	   GAZ or ISO Country field annex B? 
	 - lat/long +/- in DECIMAL so that numeric fields are supported.  
	   Conversion can go in NCBI N/S format.
	 - Date formats, esp. permitting year only, combination incorporating unit
	   selection?
	 - Future: convert Chosen <select> to ag-grid.com?
